    <p>broccoli florets that are whizzed right into the pesto sauce itself, 
        adding an even more vibrant punch of emerald green to the sauce as well as 
        a serious nutritional boost. In addition to being a great source of fiber, 
        this dark green member of the brassica family boasts lots of vitamin C and 
        vitamin A, as well as some iron, calcium and potassium. 
        Blended into a classic pesto along with some of the pasta cooking water, 
        broccoli gives this pesto sauce just a bit of creaminess and a lot more 
        oomph.</p>

    <h2>Brocoli Pesto Pasta Step-by-Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep all of your broccoli pesto ingredients—rinse the basil leaves, 
            grate your Parmigiano, peel your garlic.</li>
        <li>Bring a big pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Boil the broccoli. After two minutes, remove the florets, 
            and add your pasta.</li>
        <li>While the pasta cooks, make the pesto! Blend the broccoli, basil, garlic, 
            pine nuts, extra virgin olive oil, salt and parmigiano reggiano until 
            it’s nice and smooth.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is done, scoop out a cup of that liquid gold (aka pasta water) and add it slowly to the pesto as you blend it a bit more.</li>
        <li>Toss the pasta with the broccoli pesto and dig in!</li>
    </ol>
